# Overview

+ This repository contains all the Flutter take home projects I have done while job hunting.
+ Most of the folders are actually submodules. So if you want to visit a particular project or the job assignment, you can clone only that particular repo instead of this whole repo
+ Each folder has its own README with the job assignment and other detials the recruters ask.

# Contributing

+ Feel free to create a issue if you have a flutter take home assignment not listed here. This repo will only link to your original repo and you will still be the sole owner of the code.
